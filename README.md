## Graphics of Prime

### Navigation
Use arrow buttons on keyboard to navigate:

->......more

<-......less

|
v.......navigate down

^
|.......navigate up

The O.K. button at the left side of the screen is also pressed by using the right arrow. If you press the "O.K." button,
the new layer will be calculated and the new graphic will be shown.

### Functions

There are six bars on the left side of the screen which have the following meaning: (numbered from top to bottom)

1. 1rd color value
2. 2nd color value
3. 3st color value

4. 1st position value 
5. 2nd position value   (position values can be individual and might change if other position values are set on specific numbers)
6. 3rd position value

### Description

With this program you aren't generating random graphics, but graphics influenced by specific values. The first layer that is generated
is based on prime numbers. From there each new layer is added/changed, depending on how the values were set. This can go on until
each combination of individual values is tried through. Then the end is reached.

Currently there are 720 different combinations in color and position value of the graphic, that are possible to achieve.


Move the bars at the left side of the screen, by using the buttons shown above (arrow keys) and see what happens after you press
the "O.K." Button.
